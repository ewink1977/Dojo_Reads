# Dojo Reads

This will be an application where users will be able to post and read book reviews, as well as have functionality on editing and deleting their own reviews.

<h2>To do -</h2>

* Create sign-up and registration page.
* Create page with recent reviews.
* Create a page to add a new book and review.
* Add a page which will show reviews for books, and allow books that have already been created to be reviewed by multiple users.
* Add a profile page that will show a users reviews.
* Concentration will be on functionality, so Bootstrap will be used for visual formatting. 
* Will attempt to use AJAX when possible to avoid reloading pages unnecessarily.
